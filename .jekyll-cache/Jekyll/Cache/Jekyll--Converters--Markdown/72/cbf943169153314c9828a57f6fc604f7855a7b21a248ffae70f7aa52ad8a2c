<p>Ganquan Mao is currently a Research Assistant Professor at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China. He is mainly engaged in regional meteorology and hydrology and water resources research. The research content includes the development and application of hydrological models, the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle, the spatio-temporal evolution of water resources under global change, water related risk adaptation based ib virtual water theory, etc. He has developed bias correction toolbox CBCT (Copula-based Bias Correction Toolbox) based on Copula theory and a large-scale distributed hydrological model WAYS (Water And ecosYstem Simulator). He has so far published a total of 17 academic papers in journals such as Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, Nature Sustainability, Geoscientific Model Development, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, Water Resources Research, etc. He has also published 1 book, obtained 2 software copyrights, served as the contributing author of the IPCC 6th IPCC Assessment Report, and won the Shenzhen High-level Professional (Peacock Project).</p>
